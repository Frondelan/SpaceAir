  "Over 500,000 high altitude weather balloons are launched across the globe each year. Most are for government meteorological or research purposes, but over 3,000 amateur and educational flights are also conducted every year around the world. \n \nAlthough high altitude weather balloon launches can provide valuable results, care must be taken to abide by the governing laws and regulations to ensure weather balloon safety for aircraft and those that may be impacted by the launch and landing.";
